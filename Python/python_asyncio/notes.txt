Threading: Use when there is data sharing is there in the programme and more i/o bound tasks are there.

Asyncio: Use when there are tasks that needs to "wait" a lot with minimal CPU usage.

Processing: Use when we have heavy CPU bound tasks.


========================================= Asyncio =========================================

1. event loop:  handles asynchronous tasks, when a task needs to be executed it enters event loop
                if the task is waiting for something then loop will allow next task to enter and start work
                if the awaiting tasks completes execution then it will be executed and thus handling of the
                async tasks happens


asyncio.gather: not expert at error handling, it does not cancle other routines if one of them fails

asyncio.TaskGroup: Better at error handling and exits all co routine if one of them fails
                   It locks the block when we use it as "async with asyncio.TaskGroup()"
                   when it comes out all the coroutine has been completed execution

Why the Difference?
await: Causes the current coroutine to pause, allowing other coroutines in the event loop to run, but it waits for the specific coroutine to complete before continuing.
asyncio.create_task(): Schedules the coroutine to run concurrently. The program doesn't wait for the task to finish before it continues executing the next line of code.
